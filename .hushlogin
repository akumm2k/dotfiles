# Adding this file to $HOME turns off the login banner upon firing up
# the terminal. The banner involves, among other things, login date
# and time, system copyright notice, and message of the day (motd).
# The motd can sometimes contain important info such as system
# maintenance, security updates, etc. So we may add `cat /etc/motd` to
# the rc file.
